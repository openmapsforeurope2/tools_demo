# Demonstration of the OME2 tools

This repository contains videos produced by the Open Maps for Europe 2 – Work Package 5 team. These videos serve as a complement to the reports for each tool, which are available on the European Commission portal. The videos demonstrate how the tools can be used within the OME2 production process for topographic data.

The diagram below illustrates the process established by the project. The tools corresponding to the videos are indicated in red.
